/*
Each laser has a unique accepted range for the value read from the
photoresistor modulated voltage.  This is because bias resistance is not added
to the photoresistor circuits to accommodate the different lengths of wire
used in the individual circuit.  No bias voltage is used to equalize the laser
circuits either.

Consequently, we must fix it, like everything else, in software.
*/

// because performance is critical, we use the fastest suitable implementation
// of the for loop that works with our scenario.  the naive
//    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {}
// is approximately 50% slower than the 'cached length cool guy' loop
//    for (let i = 0, len = array.length; ++i < len;) {}
// this is purely due to how quickly the C++ engine the javascript JIT compiler
// works with the ++i operator compared to the i++ operator and the ability of
// the compiler to cache the length variable between iterations.  The behavior
// of the loop inside the lower scope is the same.
